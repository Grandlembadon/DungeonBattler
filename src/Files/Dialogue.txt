A legend tells of an ancient dungeon shrouded in mystery. Many seek it's riches, but few come back alive.
If you seek the dungeon, please enter thy name.
After a long and arduous journey, the entrance to the legendary dungeon stands before you.
The wind seems to beckon you towards the entrance of the dungeon. Will you enter? (yes/no)
You muster up your courage and enter the dungeon. A long corridor meets you with a foreboding silence.
On second thought, you decide that you are not cut out for adventure. You turn around and leave.
After an eternity of slowly shambling through the corridor, the passage seems to open up into an abandoned armory.
You can sense that somewhere in the darkness an evil lurks. You decide to search for a weapon.
After sifting through piles of bones and rusted wares, you come across a Staff, a Sword, and a Dagger.
Choose your weapon. In this dungeon, your weapon will shape the way you do combat. (Enter 0 for Staff, 1 for Sword, or 2 for Dagger)
You have chosen the Staff! As you grab the heavy oaken staff, you can sense a well of mystical energy resonate within.
You have chosen the Sword! You pick up the blade, it's heavy enough that you need both hands to give it a good swing.
You have chosen the Dagger" The small blade is nimble and easier to pick up, but the blade is sharpened to a precise point.
Soon after you test your newly acquired weapon, the faint sound of rattling bones can be heard from the darkness...
From the darkness you see a flash of light, the keen blade of a scimitar appears wielded by a shambling skeleton.
"Kehehehehe... I can see you are new to this dungeon. That weapon you have is mine, and I will have it back!"
Battle Start!
The Skeleton lunges forward at you with a downward strike!
The Skeleton conjures a shard of ice out of thin air. It rockets towards you in an instant.
The Skeleton begins to glow, his empty eye sockets now two burning pits of flame.
The Skeleton cackles as two ghostly spirits erupt from his body, and rend through your soul with a chilling touch.
You focus your spirit on the energy pulsing from the staff. A magic bolt of light erupts and strikes the skeleton!
You charge forth and swing with your mighty sword!
Like a flash of lightning, you dart forth and strike twice with your dagger.
You are victorious! The dark aura leaves the skeleton's bones as they collapse into pieces on the armory floor.
You notice some gold pieces have dropped from the skeleton's corpse, as well as a weathered scroll.
Do you pick up the gold and scroll? (y/n)
You pick up the loot and continue through the Armory. You spot a doorway not too far from where the skeleton appeared.
You make your way to the doorway, beyond it lies a set of stairs that cascade into darkness.
There's no way you can make it down there with some kind of light. Maybe you have something that can help?
You remember that you picked up a scroll from that Skeleton's corpse.
You unfurl the ancient scroll slowly, it's so weathered it seems like it could crumble in your hands.
Suddenly, the scroll rises from your grasp and hovers in the air. The scroll bursts in a flash of light.
As you squint to see the now brightly lit stairway, you notice that you body is now shrouded in light.
With your newly acquired luminescence, the stairway is no match. You descend the stairway.
The stairway leads to a Great Hall, you see various long tables littered with the bones of those who dwelled here long ago.
The room may have some supplies for your adventure. Will you ransack the room? (yes/no)
After searching the tables and the storage containers of the room, you come across 2 health potions, some gold, and A scroll that seems different than the one before.
Now that the looting is taken care of, something in the far end of the room catches your eye. There is a large throne. A dark silhouette sits in the throne.
"Fooooolish adventurer... What kind of dinner guest loots their host before proper introductions?"
The voice booms from the throne as a cold blue light radiates form the shadowy figure. All the lanterns and candles nearby flare up with the intense light.
The shadowy silhouette is now a radiant spectre. You can hear shrieking voices inside your head, wailing in fear of your impending demise.
"I am lord of this hall. You intrude on the final feast of me and my people, now you will join us in the void of time. Brace yourself."
"Rise, my brothers. Take this foolish hall plunderer's flesh from his bones."
The radiant spectre calls upon the souls of the hall, and fills two rusted suits of armor with a pale blue light.
Battle Start!
Now that you've fought in a real battle before, your battle instincts are sharpening.
You will now have a chance to strike first at the start of battle.
