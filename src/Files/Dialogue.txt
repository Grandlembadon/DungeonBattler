"A legend tells of an ancient dungeon shrouded in mystery. Many seek it's riches, but few come back alive."
"If you seek the dungeon, please enter thy name."
"After a long and arduous journey, the entrance to the legendary dungeon stands before you."
"The wind seems to beckon you towards the entrance of the dungeon. Will you enter? (yes/no)"
"You muster up your courage and enter the dungeon. A long corridor meets you with a foreboding silence."
"On second thought, you decide that you are not cut out for adventure. You turn around and leave."
"After an eternity of slowly shambling through the corridor, the passage seems to open up into an abandoned armory."
"You can sense that somewhere in the darkness an evil lurks. You decide to search for a weapon."
"After sifting through piles of bones and rusted wares, you come across a Sword, a Dagger, and a Staff."
"Choose your weapon. In this dungeon, your weapon will shape the way you do combat. (Enter 0 for Sword, 1 for Dagger, or 2 for Staff)"
"You have chosen the Staff! As you grab the heavy oaken staff, you can sense a well of mystical energy resonate within."
"You have chosen the Sword! You pick up the blade, it 's heavy enough that you need both hands to give it a good swing."
"You have chosen the Dagger" The small blade is nimble and easier to pick up, but the blade is sharpened to a precise point."
"Soon after you test your newly acquired weapon, the faint sound of rattling bones can be heard from the darkness..."
"From the darkness you see a flash of light, the keen blade of a scimitar appears wielded by a shambling skeleton."
""Kehehehehe... I can see you are new to this dungeon. That weapon you have is mine, and I will have it back!""
Battle Start!
"The Skeleton lunges forward at you with a downward strike!"
"The Skeleton conjures a shard of ice out of thin air. It rockets towards you in an instant."
"The Skeleton begins to glow, his empty eye sockets now two burning pits of flame."
"The Skeleton cackles as two ghostly spirits erupt from his body, and rend through your soul with a chilling touch."
"You are victorious! The dark aura leaves the skeleton's bones as they collapse into pieces on the armory floor."
